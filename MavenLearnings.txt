Maven:

Ant -> manually write code/scripts for each task, what tasks are and when to execute, its a combursome in wirting and complex in maintaining.

Java based projects -> powerful build process. Can automate entire build process.

What is maven?
1. Project of Apache software foundation
2. Build automation tool
3. Project management tool
4. Handles complete build process

Two critical aspects of Building software (both acheived using pom.xml)
1. Describes how software is built
2. Describes the dependencies

xml -> software is built, its dependencies, components, build order, directories and required plugins/libraries

------- 
Maven architecture
1. Local repository
2. Central/remote repository (using internet/http connectivity)
3. Build system (project.xml, maven.xml)

Maven lifecycle
default (23 phases), clean (3 phases) and site (4 phases)
validate, compile, test-compile, package (jar/war), resources, install and deploy etc phases...
Maven goals: Each phase has a specific goals

Group-ID : uniquely identifies the project package (com.res)
Artifact: maven.selenium (final name of compilation unit)
Version: version of the created artifacts
jar, pom or war
Name: name of the project

maven project directory structure:
src/main/java -> application code
src/main/resources -> all the application dependency resources
src/test/java -> all application testing code
src/test/resources -> all the application test dependency resources
JRE system libraries
pom.xml 

pom.xml =>
project tag:
version=> if contains snapshot, it indicates work is still in progress
Name, groupId, artifactId etc.. related to maven project given at the time of project creation
properties tag: 
build tag: => plugins: maven compiler plugin and maven surefire plugin-testing etc..
dependencies tag:
like selenium and testNG along with thier versions to be obtained from mvnrepository.org=> then type selenium and get the details..


***selenium is very popularly used to test web applications, also testcase management and report generation ***

mvn clean
mvn compile
mvn test-compile
